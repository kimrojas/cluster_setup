# Kraken cluster setup

![alt text](https://github.com/kimrojas/cluster_setup/blob/master/kraken.JPG)

### Description:

This setup repository should be helpful in creating a cluster setup based on **OpenHPC** and managed by **SLURM** job scheduler. This project is mainly done for making a usable cluster for Scientific calculations (QUANTUM ESPRESSO, GROMACS, VASP, Python-based codes)

Disclaimer: This repository is actually meant to guide me when I forget how to do this.   

This Setup guide is will have two set of files:

| Set | Description |
|:---:|---|
| Manual | This is the line-by-line guidelines for the setup |
| Rapid Deployment Protocol | This is a script (that should be edited for use in specific system) that can be used to do all the commands in "Manual" set |
