# Kraken cluster setup

![alt text](https://github.com/kimrojas/cluster_setup/blob/master/kraken.JPG)

### Description:

This setup repository should be helpful in creating a cluster setup based on **OpenHPC** and managed by **SLURM** job scheduler. This project is mainly done for making a usable cluster for Scientific calculations (QUANTUM ESPRESSO, GROMACS, VASP, Python-based codes)

Disclaimer: This repository is actually meant to guide me when I forget how to do this.
